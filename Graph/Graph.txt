Graph are of 2 types 1. Directed 2. Undirected

Acyclic Graph: that does not form a cycle
Cyclic Graph: that forms a cycle

degree: no. of edges connected to a nodes

indegree: no. of edges coming to a nodes
outdegree: no. of edges going out of the node



Graph can be implemented int two ways 

1. using adjacency matrix-->2D matrix
2. using adjacency list-->map/vector/set/list


adjacency matrix : nxn ka matrix banao fir agar do nodes ke beech me edge hai to 1 mark kardo else 0

0---------1          
|       / |
|     /   |
|   /     |
| /       |
2         3

iss Graph ki adjacency matrix banegi

    {0,1,1,0}
    {1,0,1,1}
    {1,1,0,0}
    {0,1,0,0}

adjacency list: isme har node ke corresponding ek list banaenge jisme jis jis element ke sath uski edge hai vo honge
